  content: "We are group of passionate technologists, native to the South Pacific, who have built up years of experience working with modern systems and delivering digital transformations for some of the largest companies and organizations, mostly in the US including even the US government itself. We've decided to bring these experiences back home in order to help organizations, on this oft-forgotten side of the world, learn how to leverage modern software designs and architecture, development practices and techniques, IT systems and service management, Open Source software, and automation in order to produce **secure**, **reliable**, **cost-effective**, and easily **maintanable** solutions."

Where a teenager with a dream and a laptop can start the next billion dollar software company. Where tiny countries, like Israel and Singapore, can compete on the global stage.</br></br> Of course, opportunities cannot act in and of themselves. They must be acted upon in order for the benefits to be realized. Our mission is to help individuals and organizations ACT.

They're typically identified with simple questions such as \"How can we manage this better?\", \"How can we speed this up?\", \"Is there a more cost-effective way to do this?\", and so on. From these simple questions, we can start to build a story; The setting, the characters involved, the stuggles, the goals, and even a desired outcome. We then use this story to design the right solution to realize that desired outcome."
